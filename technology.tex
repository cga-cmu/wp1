\section{Executive Summary}

Executive Summary to be written.

\section{Scope: What is this paper about?}

This paper surveys near-term exoskeleton technology with an
emphasis on control.
A companion paper surveys implemented exoskeleton technology~\cite{}.

The focus is on near-term exoskeleton technologies that allow a
highly trained and top percentile athletic 
operator to carry a payload that weighs approximately the same amount
as the operator. We envisage these types of exoskeletons to be useful
in carrying protective and safety equipment for SWAT teams, police,
firefighters, and soldiers. 

We do not survey exoskeleton technology for human arms. 
We treat the torso and helmet of the exoskeleton as the payload,
and focus on a lower body exoskeleton to support any payloads that
are on the torso or head.
We do not cover global energy storage such as batteries or liquid fuel
or other global power system issues.

A later white paper will discuss the use of propulsive forces other
than foot contacts, as well as additional actuation at the contacts (air
bags, springs, other ways to rapidly apply stored energy) for
operator safety (dodging threats, ...) and high performance (jumping, ...).

A future white paper will discuss near term soft robotics technology
for exoskeletons.

\section{What are the specs?}

Hip, knee, ankle: At least 100Nm, more is better.

\subsection{What speeds and forces are needed to walk?}

\subsection{What speeds and forces are needed to run?}

\subsection{What operator-exoskeleton contact forces are acceptable?}

\section{What performance is currently available?}

\subsection{Reference Design: linear hydraulic with bypass valves}

Survey state of the art using linear hydraulic actuators:
Sarcos Primus Humanoid, Atlas(BDI), Cheetah(BDI)

{\it 140 bar(2,050 psi) and 8 lpm in total. Hydraulic cylinders
are designed to be double-acting at the hip pitch joint and
the knee pitch joint. The hip and knee cylinders are designed
for a maximum thrust of 4 kN and 2 kN, respectively. The
four three-way servo valves(M 200, Star-Hydraulic)}~\cite{IEEE07222598}

BLEEX: carries
up to a 34 kg (75 lb) payload for the pilot and allows the pilot to
walk at up to 1.3 m/s (2.9 mph).

{\bf HyQ:}
We normally operate at 180-200 bar. The maximum speed for the HyQ
linear actuators with no load is 1.1m/s, I don't know about HyQ2Max.
The maximum force for the HyQ actuators is 4000 N, and for HyQ2Max is
6000 N.

{\bf Integrated Moog hydraulic actuator:}
The integrated Moog system is still very experimental,� there are
only two working prototypes right now.� Our lab is working closely
with Moog to develop the firmware for the builtin controllers. I
think it is a little early to say how well they work, but it looks
promising.


\subsection{Reference Design: linear electric}

Survey state of the art using linear electric actuators (typically ballscrews):
Roboray (Samsung)

\subsection{Reference Design: rotary electric}

Survey state of the art using rotary electric actuators:
Schaft~\cite{shaft_foot_placement,shaft_push_recov}, Cheetah(MIT)

Maxon dc flat brushless motor EC45 and servo controller
Elmo. The servomotor emulates the kinematic profile of every
joint and sends a digital signal to the Elmo to form feedbacks.
In order to enhance the impedance capability, harmonic trans-
mission drivers are implemented (model SHD-17-100-2SH
for joints 1 and 2, model SHD-14-100-2SH for joints 3 and 4,
and CSF-32-50-2A-GR for joint 5).~\cite{IEEE07128705}

\subsection{Reference Design: linear pneumatic}

of each loadcell is chosen from the analysis of GRF for
level walking : Hallux(toe), first Metatarsal(inside), fourth
Metatarsal(outside), and Heel similar to [20], as shown in
Fig. 2(a). The Gait phase detection is simply classified
into two phases by the threshold method using the sum
of the load cells: Single Stance (Left Stance(LS) or Right
Stance(RS)), Double Stance(DS). The result of gait detection
while walking is shown in Fig. 2(b).}~\cite{IEEE07222598}

\section{Energy Storage}

We will only address energy storage
in terms of control issues.

\subsection{Global energy storage}

\begin{verbatim}
 battery
 gasoline/jet fuel/diesel
 chemical (explosive actuation: solid fuel rocket, liquid fuel rocket)
 pressurized gas
 other?
 energy boost systems (jump, escape response in biology)
  chemical (explosive actuation: solid fuel rocket, liquid fuel rocket)
  pressurized gas
  spring
  other?
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Joint-level/local energy storage (on joint or synergy)}

Can we use local energy storage to assist control: charging batteries,
pressurizing accumulators, using springs, ... ?

{\it incorporation of physical
compliance is of importance when it comes to dependability,
low mechanical impedance, locomotion efficiency, inherent
safety and enhanced environmental interaction capabilities}~\cite{IEEE07139975}

\begin{verbatim}
 accumulator (really an air spring)
 physical springs/damping
 supercapacitor/battery/electrical for local electric braking
\end{verbatim}

\section{Actuation}

Survey possible actuation systems.

What role do physical properties of actuation play in control? Highly
geared electric systems and hydraulic systems are inherently very
stiff and go where you want, but must be made compliant/backdrivable
using high performance (expensive and fragile) force control.
Pneumatics and Series Elastic Actuation (SEA) are inherently
compliant/backdrivable, which may reduce the performance
needed from the sensors and control system, but may not be able to
produce needed forces and speeds.

\subsection{Global actuation}

\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{Joint-level/synergy/local actuation}

\begin{verbatim}

  chemical (air bag style: explosive actuation: solid/liquid fuel rocket)
  pressurized gas
  spring
  other?
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Flywheels}

Energy storage and actuation for high manueverability.

\subsection{Hybrid actuation}

Different types of actuation can be combined: springs and electric motors,
for example. This combination can also be viewed as combining energy
storage and actuation. Slow pneumatics and fast electric motors~\cite{Morimoto,UCLA}.
Mini/Macro~\cite{Stanford}. In this view, the human operator is just
one more set of actuators to be added to the combined system.

\begin{verbatim}
parallel combinations - weak fast actuator needs to hit joint limit and then be strong.
 (leads to chattering) or just lock in position to exert big force
series combination - strong actuator needs to clutch out of circuit to move fast
\end{verbatim}

\section{Transmissions and Drive Trains}

\subsection{How can clutches and gear shifts help?}

How can we implement a gear shifting system (the crucial mechanical
system missing in current robots)? How do we switch from manipulation
while standing, walking, running, other rapid movement (dodging), and
power movements (jumping, moving through doors and walls)?

Stance leg requires a large torque and
relatively low bandwidth during the support period. However,
the swing leg undergoes a large motion, but it only supports
its own weight during the swing period. Therefore, the swing
leg requires a relatively small torque. Thus, a dual-mode
approach is very useful for an exoskeleton robot control.
In this paper, a dual-mode control method using a hydraulic
system is proposed,~\cite{IEEE07222598}

\section{System issues}

Things that don't fit well elsewhere.

\begin{verbatim}
 bearing play, structural flexibility: +/- 2cm COM uncertainty
 how attached to human (exoskeleton)
 air bags
\end{verbatim}

The human and exoskeleton limbs are typically connected to each
other with straps or padding. These connections typically have substantial
compliance and play, and may or may not have appropriate damping.
Typically the human and the exoskeleton do not move the same way:
pose, and linear and angular velocities and accelerations are not the same.

Heat exhaust. Heatsink cooling, Force air cooling, Water cooling.
Will housing and structure get too hot and fry operator?

\section{Discussion}

{\bf Weight distribution:}
There is a weight distribution issue. Ideally the exoskeleton should
have a center of mass at the same location as the operator. Otherwise,
operator movements can be degraded and substantial forces occur between
the operator and the exoskeleton.
This constraint can be reduced with the use of propulsive forces other
than foot contacts: rockets (solid or liquid fuel), jets, exploding armor,
ducted fan air flow, ...

{\bf One Time Use:}
What happens if the suit is "one time use"? For example, ablative armor,
armor that reacts to incoming projectiles before they hit,
or explosive shielding could be used. Could the armor weight be decreased?
The expensive parts of the suit could be re-usable, and even autonomously
return to safe areas.

{\bf Do we need physical contact?}
Current exoskeletons use physical contact with the operator to control
the exoskeleton. Can we make an exoskeleton that does not touch or
minimally touches the operator, and in which there is no power
transfer between the operator and the exoskeleton? These types of
systems might allow an operator to behave more normally, have a
greater range of movement, be less tiring, and for non-enclosing
systems, allow the operator to move independently of the system (such
as aim and fire standard weapons or dive for cover) for additional
operator performance and safety.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
A "fat suit" or "sumo suit" could fully enclose the operator, but
use distance sensing to move with the operator.
\item
A "shield" could enclose the front of an operator (or whatever
portion of the operator is threatened) and move with the operator,
\item
A "human shield" (actually a machine shield) could move ahead of
an operator, mimicking the operators movement.
\item
An "angel" could walk, jump, or fly between an operator and potential
hostile sites, and deflect or disable projectiles.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}

1) We recommend the exploration of how to implement and utilize practical
gear shifts and clutches (or equivalents). For hydraulics and air, this might mean
bypass or other special valve features.
For electric motors and gears, this might mean special purpose clutch mechanisms
built into gearing or harmonic drives. For linear actuators, antagonistic actuation
combined with tendons that can go slack can be used for clutching.

2) We recommend exploring the combination of passive energy storage (springs,
accumulators, supercapacitors, ...) with active actuation. One form of this
is series elastic actuation. 

3) We also recommend exploring storing energy with
a ``catch'' and ``explosive release'' for overdrive capabilities. 

4) We recommend the exploration of hybrid actuation, where slow and strong actuators
are combined with fast but weak actuators either in parallel or serial.

5) We recommend the exploration of multi-joint or synergy actuation, where an actuator
might cross two or more joints.

6) We recommend the exploration of integrated actuation units using 3D printing
or other rapid prototyping techniques, such as the integrated Moog hydraulic
actuator for HyQ.

7) We recommend applying as many sensors as possible, and asking the performers
to make it easy to add more by making the sensor network available in the design.
This maximizes the probability of success
by enabling multiple control
approaches to be implemented, refined, and support each other.
In particular, we would like to see force sensing between the operator and the
exoskeleton, including at the feet, as much force sensing between the exoskeleton 
and the world as possible, but minimally full six-axis force/torque sensing at
the exoskeleton feet (where they touch the ground). We would like to see multiple MEMs
IMUs (measuring linear acceleration and angular velocity) installed across 
the exoskeleton and at least one high quality fiber optic gyro IMU.
We would like to see high quality direct velocity sensing
such as high count (100,000 counts/revolution) encoders and/or 
analog rotary or linear tachometers on actuators and joints. 
We would like to see actuator force or torque sensors
(load cells or equivalents) with the measurement on the link side (rather than
the actuator side) of any transmission. Electric current in motors and oil
pressure in hydraulic pistons can also be used for actuator force estimation,
but because these measurements are on the actuator side before the transmission
and in the case of hydraulics before the oil seals on the piston, these measurements
are greatly contaminated by friction. On the Atlas humanoid we typically saw 10Nm
joint torque estimation errors for a system that estimated actuator output using
oil pressure on each side of the piston head.
A possible objection to this is additional cost. We feel it is a false
economy to skimp on sensing. Leaving practical sensing out greatly increases
the risk of poor performance.

8) Do we recommend flywheels?
