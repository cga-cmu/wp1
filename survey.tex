\section{Executive Summary}

Executive Summary to be written.

\section{Scope: What is this paper about?}

This paper surveys exoskeleton control architectures and
algorithms.
The focus is on exoskeleton control that allows a
highly trained and top percentile athletic 
operator to carry a payload that weighs approximately the same amount
as the operator. We envisage these types of exoskeletons to be useful
in carrying protective and safety equipment for SWAT teams, police,
firefighters, and soldiers. 
We also 
focus this survey on exoskeleton control for lower body tasks (standing, walking,
running, jumping, kicking, dodging, ...).

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}

All the (strength augmentation) exoskeletons we reviewed can be categorized into one of two general control categories.  The exoskeleton either directly measures user intent (e.g., from EMG data or human-exoskeleton interaction forces), or it estimates intent from measurements at exoskeleton joints and applies a sensitivity amplification strategy to shadow the wearer.  The first strategy is difficult to implement using standard sensing modalities.  For instance, EMG data is notoriously noisy and presents both modeling and calibration challenges.  It would also be extremely difficult to keep these sensors in place to obtain accurate readings in a combat scenario.  Similarly, many avoid the use of load cells for measurement of the human-exoskeleton interface fores to avoid outfitting the complicated sensor network required to accurate obtain interaction forces / torques (humans are compliant thus rigid attachment assumptions are typically inadequate).

While sensitivity amplification strategies avoid these sensing issues by estimating human intent from exoskeleton joint readings, they cannot distinguish between user generated torques and those produced by the environment.  As such, they end up amplifying noise and the user must react to stabilize the system.  This is also unacceptable for a combat exoskeleton.

Notes:

See if the Hydraulic Lower Extremity Exo is sensitivity amp and if so change opinion so we don't favor the approach.

Coordinate notes about sEMG and user intention -- BLEEX;

Discussion blurb -- all these exos either measure user intention directly and have sensor noise and calibration challenges, or measure at the suit and perform amplification.  The amplification strategy is highly susceptible to outside disturbances and therefore not appropriate in combat situations.
Combine the two with filtering or directly address the sensing challenge.

Discussion blurb (pertains to IHMC and probably others) -- issues with high impedance torque control in practice.

Talk a lot about drawbacks of SEAs in IHMC.  Are these included in MIT / RoboKnee?  (low control bandwidth is mentioned in RoboKnee).  
We should have a blurb about the strengths/weakness of SEAs and possible options -- stiffer springs for force measurement and spring emulation for compliant control?
